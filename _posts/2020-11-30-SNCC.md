[SNCC](https://vimeo.com/461037507) (film) by Danny Lyon.

Created by scanning the thousands of unpublished photographs Lyon made 58 years ago in the deep south, and using audio recordings made by Alan Ribback inside the Movement churches, along with interviews Lyon made in 1989 of John Lewis, Julian Bond and others, SNCC is a compilation film so radical in its approach as to redefine the term documentary.
