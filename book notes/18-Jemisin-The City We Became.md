# The City We Became, NK Jemisin

A sci-fi story where cities have human embodiments.

The forces of gentrification also have an embodiment, with the unsubtle name of "Dr White" when in human form,
but also taking the form of other white blobs which blank out what they touch.

## Defining gentrification

BK: The book celebrates what is unique to the city, and implies that chains and other things that are common to
all cities are gentrification:

"Even eldritch abominations can't get a construction permit overnight in _this_ city. Which means
_Dr White_ has been planning her move for a lot longer than just the past two or three days. ...
This is a new sickness, and _I should have noticed_. They're destroying everything that makes New
York what it is, replacing it with generic _bullshit_."


## Defining who is a resident
Are the residents of those luxury condos part of a city, or outside invaders?

BK: The position of the book seems to be that true members of a city contribute something
interesting back, and those who import a common middle-class sensibility do not.
Brooklyn brownstones are celebrated as uniquely part of New York, and even the addition of a
handicap elevator to the front makes the space less Brooklyn.
Yet even these rows of brownstones were at some point a housing project for the middle-to-uppper
class of another era.
